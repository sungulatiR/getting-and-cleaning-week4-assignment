# getting-and-cleaning-week4-assignment
This project demonstrates the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Following is submitted: 
1) A tidy data set.
2) A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3) CodeBook.md book describes the variables, the data, transformations and work performed to clean up the data. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

R script called run_analysis.R performs the following. 

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
